## Reflection

As I developed my math toolkit, I noticed that many functions showed comparable patterns. Many of them received input, carried out a minor calculation, and produced a value. Writing predictions initially allowed me to pause and consider what each function needed to accomplish before testing, simplifying the debugging process significantly.

The toughest aspect was considering edge cases, such as negative values or zero. At times, I was surprised when a function acted differently than I thought, which shows the significance of testing.

I can understand how this would be beneficial for bigger projects. Dividing a problem into smaller, testable functions simplifies code debugging and enhances reuse. A toolkit of this kind might be included in a larger library that other applications depend on, which would save time and minimize mistakes.
